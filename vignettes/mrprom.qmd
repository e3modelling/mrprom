## Framework idea<br>
The problem with Excel tables:<br>
Intransparent<br>
Not reproducible<br>
Virtually impossible to track changes<br>
Error-prone<br>
Not suitable for large datasets<br>
Use of proprietary software

The Solution:<br>
MADRaT (May All Data be Reproducible and Transparent)<br>
Dietrich et al. (2025). "madrat: May All Data be Reproducible and Transparent (MADRaT)"<br>
"Tools used"
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Tools used"}
knitr::include_graphics(system.file("extdata/14.png", package = "mrprom"))
```
Typical workflow mrprom:
A) requires a local directory to store data such as downloaded  source data, cache files, and output<br>
B) has the ability to load data from cache rather than recompute it when the calculations have run already before<br>
C) splits the data preparation into separate steps<br>

```
"Typical workflow"
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Process of data preparation"}

"Use-cases (Adding a new source)"
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=""}
knitr::include_graphics(system.file("extdata/17.png", package = "mrprom"))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Use-cases (Adding a new source)"}
knitr::include_graphics(system.file("extdata/18.png", package = "mrprom"))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Use-cases (Adding a new source)"}
knitr::include_graphics(system.file("extdata/19.png", package = "mrprom"))
```
## FuelCons
The IEA dataset includes 160 countries and 29 regions with data available through 2023<br>
while all remaining countries in the 249-country output of calcOutput should be assigned zeros.<br>
The function readIEA2025() is responsible for importing these IEA values,<br>
maps them to the corresponding countries and regions used by the model, and explicitly fills in zero values for all<br> countries that are not covered by the IEA database.<br>
The regional aggregation performed in fullOPEN_PROM.
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Example: read IEA balances
# data <- readIEA2025()
```
"Map between IEA flow and OPEM-PROM subsectors"
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="prom-iea-sbs.csv"}
knitr::include_graphics(system.file("extdata/2.png", package = "mrprom"))
```
"Map between IEA and OPEM-PROM fuels"
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="prom-iea-fuelcons-mapping.csv"}
knitr::include_graphics(system.file("extdata/3.png", package = "mrprom"))
```
"Disaggegation of Heat to various EFs by using Heat output of IEA"
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=""}
knitr::include_graphics(system.file("extdata/4.png", package = "mrprom"))
```
"Disaggregate Transport IEA sectors to Transport sector (e.g., GSL ROAD -> PC,PB,GU). The shares are from Eurostat"
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=""}
knitr::include_graphics(system.file("extdata/5.png", package = "mrprom"))
```

## FuelPrice
The IEA dataset contains information for 145 countries and 6 regions through 2023.<br>
The readIEATOTPRICES() function is responsible for importing these data.<br>
Within this function, the dataset is filtered where product = PRICE_TOTAL and CURENCY = USD_R,<br>
ensuring that only total price data expressed in real U.S. dollars are retained.<br>
Region mean is used for the rest of the countries that do not have data.<br>
The map that is used is `regionmappingH12.csv`.
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Example: read IEA total prices
# data <- readIEATOTPRICES()
#
# # Filter for PRICE_TOTAL and USD_R
# filtered <- subset(data, product == "PRICE_TOTAL" & CURENCY == "USD_R")

```
"Map between IEA prices and OPEM-PROM prices"
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="prom-IEA-fuprice-mapping.csv"}
knitr::include_graphics(system.file("extdata/6.png", package = "mrprom"))
```
The units are converted to "USD2015/toe" in `convertIEATOTPRICES()`.<br>
Region mean is used for the rest of the countries that do not have data.<br>
The map that is used is `regionmappingH12.csv`.<br>
In the end H2F takes the biggest value of fuel that has each subsector
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="regionmappingH12.csv"}
knitr::include_graphics(system.file("extdata/7.png", package = "mrprom"))
```
## ElecProd
The IEA dataset provides information for 169 countries and 17 regions up to the year 2023,<br>
and all remaining countries in the 249-country structure used by the calcOutput function are assigned a value of zero.<br>
The readIEA2025() function is responsible for importing these data and handling<br>
the three available modes—NonCHP, CHP, and Total, map them to the model’s country list,<br>
and fill in zeros for countries not included in the IEA dataset. Regional aggregation is then<br>
performed downstream in fullOPEN_PROM<br>
There are 3 modes: NonCHP, CHP and Total
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Example: read IEA balances
# data <- readIEA2025()
```
"Map between IEA flow and OPEM-PROM modes. Depending to the mode there is different IEA flow"
```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.cap="IEA flow and OPEM-PROM modes"}
  # if (mode == "NonCHP") {
  #   subset <- c("ELMAINE", "ELAUTOE")
  # } else if (mode == "CHP") {
  #   subset <- c("ELMAINC", "ELAUTOC")
  # } else if (mode == "Total") {
  #   subset <- "ELOUTPUT"
  # }
```
"Map between IEA and OPEM-PROM fuels"
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="prom-iea-fuelcons-mapping.csv"}
knitr::include_graphics(system.file("extdata/8.png", package = "mrprom"))
```
"For modes NonCHP and Total the map that is used is"
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=""}
knitr::include_graphics(system.file("extdata/9.png", package = "mrprom"))
```
"For mode CHP is"
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=""}
knitr::include_graphics(system.file("extdata/10.png", package = "mrprom"))
```
"To take the shares of technologies that are missing IInstCapPast (Capacity) function is used"
```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.cap=""}
# calcOutput(type = "IInstCapPast", mode = "Total", aggregate = FALSE)
```
## Capacity
ENERDATA provides data for 179 countries and 2 regions up to the year 2021,<br>
and all remaining countries in the 249-country structure required by the calcOutput function<br>
are assigned zero values to ensure full global coverage.<br>
The readENERDATA() function is responsible for importing these ENERDATA inputs,<br>
mapping the available country and regional entries to the model’s complete country list.<br>
Once the full 249-country dataset is constructed, the regional aggregation is carried out in fullOPEN_PROM.<br>
There are 4 modes: NonCHP, CHP, Total and TotalEff.
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Example: read ENERDATA balances
# data <- readENERDATA()
```
There are 4 modes: NonCHP, CHP, Total and TotalEff.<br>
For modes: NonCHP, CHP electricity production is used.
```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.cap="NonCHP, CHP"}
    # capacities <- calcOutput(
    #   type = "IDataElecProd", mode = mode, aggregate = FALSE
    # ) / hoursYear
```
For modes: Total, ENERDATA is used with the map prom-enerdata-pgall-mapping.csv
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="prom-enerdata-pgall-mapping.csv"}
knitr::include_graphics(system.file("extdata/11.png", package = "mrprom"))
```
For the TotalEff mode, ENERDATA is used together with the country-mapping file prom-enerdata-pgall-mapping.csv,<br>
following the same mapping approach as in the Total mode. After the ENERDATA values are mapped to the full 249-country<br> structure, availability rates from the relevant function (calcOutput(type = "IAvailRate", aggregate = FALSE))<br>
are applied by multiplying them with the mapped ENERDATA data.
```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.cap=""}
# calcOutput(type = "IAvailRate", aggregate = FALSE)
```
## TransfProcess
IEA provides data for 160 countries and 29 regions up to 2023, and all remaining countries in the 249-country<br>
structure expected by calcOutput are assigned zero values to ensure full coverage.<br>
The model handles three modes—Total, CHP, and DHP—and two flows, Inp and Out.<br>
The readIEA2025() function is responsible for importing the IEA dataset,<br>
filtering and structuring it according to mode and flow,<br>
mapping the available IEA entries to the full country list, and filling in zeros<br>
for countries not included in the IEA database.<br>
Regional aggregation is then performed in fullOPEN_PROM.
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Example: read IEA balances
# data <- readIEA2025()
```
Map between IEA flow and OPEM-PROM depending to the mode<br>
If the mode is Total, then all available IEA data are used directly;<br>
otherwise, the dataset is filtered to include only CHP or DHP values depending on the selected mode.
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="iea-transfProcess-mapping.csv"}
knitr::include_graphics(system.file("extdata/12.png", package = "mrprom"))
```
Map between IEA and OPEM-PROM fuels
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="prom-iea-fuelcons-mapping.csv"}
knitr::include_graphics(system.file("extdata/13.png", package = "mrprom"))
```
If the flow is Inp, the negative values from the IEA dataset are selected,<br>
whereas if the flow is Out, the positive values are taken.

## calcACTV
Economic activity data for OPENPROM sectors are derived by combining two data sources. The first source covers<br> transport-related activity, including traffic and air transport passengers, provided per country and per year by IRF.<br>
The second source comes from GEME3, which supplies Production Level and Unit Cost data for the relevant sectors. 
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# x <- readSource("GEME3", convert = TRUE) #nolint
```
Map between GEME3 and OPEM-PROM depending
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="prom_geme3_map.csv"}
knitr::include_graphics(system.file("extdata/20.png", package = "mrprom"))
```

## calcIAvailRate
Represents the calculation of the plant availability rate by dividing production by installed capacity.<br>
Specifically, the production data are obtained from the calcOutput function with the type set to "IDataElecProd",<br>
the mode set to "Total". The installed capacity data are similarly obtained from calcOutput with the type set to<br> "IInstCapPast", the mode set to "Total".<br>
The availability rate is then calculated as production divided by installed capacity, expressed as a percentage,<br>
which indicates the proportion of the installed capacity that is actually generating electricity.
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#   Prod <- calcOutput(type = "IDataElecProd", mode = "Total", aggregate = FALSE) %>% as.quitte()
#   Cap <- calcOutput(type = "IInstCapPast", mode = "Total", aggregate = FALSE) %>% as.quitte()
```

## calcIChpPowGen

```

## calcIDataDistrLosses

The data are sourced from the IEA for 160 regions, while all remaining regions or countries are assigned a value of zero. 
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#   distrLosses <- readSource("IEA2025", subset = "DISTLOSS")
```

#     EffCapacities <- calcOutput(type = "IInstCapPast", mode="TotalEff", aggregate = FALSE) 
```
If there is value from NominalCapacities the data that is taken is from ENERDATA.
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#     readSource("ENERDATA", "capacity", convert = TRUE)
```
Afterwards, the data are multiplied by a reference table
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#           PEAKLOAD = TOTCAP * 0.9,
#      BASELOAD = PEAKLOAD * 0.3576,
#      Non_CHP_Per = 0.00000001,
#      CHP_Cap = 0.00000001,
#      CHP_ELC = 0.00000001,
#      # STE1CL = 0.0, STE1CH = 0.0, STE1CD = 0.0,
#      # STE1CR = 0.0, STE1CG = 0.0, STE1CB = 0.0,
#      STE1AL = 0.0, STE1AH = 0.0, STE1AD = 0.0,
```

## calcIDataGrossInlCons

Creating projections for the spot prices of gasoline, diesel and heavy fuel oil
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#      curr <- i
#    prev <- i - 1
#    Calculating the oil price ratio for each year
#    oil_price_ratio <- x[, curr, "WCRO"] / x[, prev, "WCRO"]
#    Calculating the projection by multiplying the previous price by the oil price ratio
#    x[, curr, "WGSL"] <- x[, prev, "WGSL"] * oil_price_ratio
#    x[, curr, "WGDO"] <- x[, prev, "WGSL"] * oil_price_ratio
#    x[, curr, "WRFO"] <- x[, prev, "WRFO"] * oil_price_ratio

## calcIRateLossesFinCons
Use IEA and IRF data to derive OPENPROM input parameter iRateLossesFinCons
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#        dl <- calcOutput("IDataDistrLosses", aggregate = FALSE), losses in energy distribution
#        x <- calcOutput("IFuelCons2", aggregate = FALSE)
#        consumption[,,"STE"], filter by STEAM
#        a <- dl / consumption
```

## calcISFC
Derive Specific fuel consumption per car technology for all countries.<br>
To estimate country-level specific fuel consumption (SFC), stock of passenger<br>
cars is first taken from calcOutput(type = "ACTV") for entries where variable == "PC".<br>
European Union values are complemented with transport indicators from<br>
readSource("PrimesNewTransport", subtype = "Indicators"), aggregating all<br>
remaining EU countries into a unified “rest of EU” group. Total final energy use<br>
per country is then derived from calcOutput(type = "IFuelCons2", subtype = "TRANSE"),<br>
which is scaled by each country’s car stock and an assumed mean annual<br>
driving distance of 15,000 km to produce aggregate SFC (i.e., value / stock / 15000).<br>
Technology-specific SFC values are estimated by scaling the European reference SFC<br>
with the ratio between each country’s aggregate SFC and the EU aggregate SFC<br>
(i.e., meanSFC × value / meanSFCEU). Only results whose deviation from<br>
the baseline country is within ±50 % are retained; for new technologies,<br>
the baseline EU SFC is used directly. Any missing values (NAs) are finally<br>
filled using the corresponding baseline country’s SFC.

## calcISuppExports
Use data from ENERDATA to derive OPENPROM input parameter iSuppExports.<br>
This dataset includes export values for each region and fuel type in Mtoe.
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#        x <- readSource("ENERDATA", "ports", convert = TRUE)
```
Map between ENERDATA and OPEN-PROM.
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="prom-enerdata-exports-mapping.csv"}
knitr::include_graphics(system.file("extdata/34.png", package = "mrprom"))
```
Region mean is used for the rest of the countries that do not have data.<br>
The map that is used is `regionmappingH12.csv`.

## calcISuppRatePrimProd
Use data from IEA to derive OPENPROM input parameter iSuppRatePrimProd.<br>
Primary energy supply is obtained using calcOutput(type = "ITotEneSupply", subtype = "Primary"),<br>
with renewable and non-combustible sources (HYD, BMSWAS, NUC, WND, SOL, GEO)<br>
set to unity to act as normalizing factors. Total energy supply (TES) is defined<br>
as domestic production + inputs from other sources + imports − exports, using TES<br>
data from readSource("IEA2025", subset = "TES"). Aggregate totals across fuels<br>
are generated via dimSums(..., dim = 3.1). Sectoral final energy consumption is<br>
drawn from calcOutput(type = "IFuelCons2") for domestic, industrial,<br>
and transport subsectors. Refinery transformation inputs are taken from<br>
readSource("IEA2025", subset = "TREFINER"), representing the use of hydrocarbons<br>
for producing refined oil products. Energy-industry-own-use is taken from<br>
readSource("IEA2025", subset = "TOTENGY"), while interproduct transfers and<br>
recycled products are captured through readSource("IEA2025", subset = "TRANSFERS").<br>
To compute primary supply shares, each fuel’s primary production is divided by<br>
the sum of total fuel supply
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#        (e.g., x[, , "CRO"] <- x[, , "CRO"] / y)
```
yielding normalized contributions of each primary energy source.<br>
Region mean is used for the rest of the countries that do not have data.<br>
The map that is used is `regionmappingH12.csv`.
