ENERDATA has data for 179 countries and 2 regions until year 2021.<br>
For the rest of the countries it is 0.<br>
calcOutput function has as an output 249 countries.<br>
The aggregation to regions is performed in fullOPEN_PROM.<br>
The `readENERDATA()` function is used to read ENERDATA data.<br>
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Example: read ENERDATA balances
# data <- readENERDATA()
```
There are 4 modes: NonCHP, CHP, Total and TotalEff.<br>
For modes: NonCHP, CHP electricity production is used.
```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.cap="NonCHP, CHP"}
    # capacities <- calcOutput(
    #   type = "IDataElecProd", mode = mode, aggregate = FALSE
    # ) / hoursYear
```
For modes: Total, ENERDATA is used with the map prom-enerdata-pgall-mapping.csv
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="prom-enerdata-pgall-mapping.csv"}
knitr::include_graphics(system.file("extdata/11.png", package = "mrprom"))
```
For modes: TotalEff, ENERDATA is used with the map prom-enerdata-pgall-mapping.csv<br>,
same as Total and by applying Applying avail rates (multiply) from function
```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.cap=""}
# calcOutput(type = "IAvailRate", aggregate = FALSE)
```
