calcNDC_LTT_NECP()
}
\value{
A list with the elements: magpie object with absolute emissions targets in Mt CO2e/yr and some metadata.
}
\description{
Reads the raw input table for the dataset type \code{"NDC_LTT_NECP"} and
derives **absolute unconditional and conditional emissions targets** for each
country and target year.
}
\details{
The raw file can contain targets expressed as:
\itemize{
  \item absolute target emissions (preferred, used directly),
  \item percent reduction relative to a base-year emissions level, or
  \item percent reduction relative to a BAU emissions level.
}

Targets are parsed from three blocks in the source file:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{Interim/First NDC},
  \item \strong{Revised NDC},
  \item \strong{Long-Term target (LTT)}.
}
\strong{Calculation rules}
\itemize{
  \item If an absolute target is available (\code{absEmissionsUncond*} /
    \code{absEmissionsCond*}), it is used as-is.
  \item Else, if base-year emissions and percent reduction are available,
    the target is computed as \eqn{baseEmis * (1 - pct/100)}.
  \item Else, if BAU emissions and percent reduction are available,
    the target is computed as \eqn{bauEmis * (1 - pct/100)}.
  \item Otherwise the target is \code{NA}.
}

For Long-Term targets, the file often stores a single target value; it is
interpreted as an unconditional absolute target when numeric. Textual targets
(e.g., "Net Zero") will become \code{NA} after numeric conversion.
